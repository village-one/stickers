# Village One: source files for our stickers

Hi, we are [Village One](https://www.village.one), a worker-owned and somewhat utopian studio for ethical design and technology. Since our founding in 2022 we’ve occasionally printed sticker sets, usually around the themes of worker empowerment, solidarity, cooperatives and ethical design/tech.

We hand them out at conferences, send them to friends and clients, stick them on our phones and laptops. People frequently ask us if they can have a few. Therefore this repo holds all our sticker images as SVGs and high-res PNGs, under a permissive license, so you can print them yourself! It also serves for our own reference. [You can find photo impressions over on our website.](https://www.village.one/garden/library/village-one-stickers)

## File structure and some notes

Each folder contains one sticker motif, sometimes in multiple variants, e.g. different color themes. There’s always a high-res PNG and an SVG. Some of the files have transparent areas, because we printed them as holographic stickers—this may or may not work for you, depending on your chosen printing service. Feel free to modify according to your needs.

The SVGs are not the cleanest files and may have issues, like odd layer grouping or too many vector points. Some of the stickers were not created by designers, some of them were done in a rush, initially we also never suspected to release the files publically. You know how it is, better done than prfect.

## License

We are releasing all of these assets under a Creative Commons license, specifically [CC BY-NC-SA 4.0](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-sa/4.0/) (ATTRIBUTION-NONCOMMERCIAL-SHAREALIKE 4.0 INTERNATIONAL).

This means you can take our files, reproduce and modify them for personal use, but you are not allowed to sell them or release them under a different license. As an example, it’s fine to change some colors, print a bunch of stickers, stick them on your laptop and hand them out at a conference, but please don’t put them on t-shirts to sell in your Shopify shop. It would also be nice if you gave us credit, e.g. when you share your stickers in a social media post, but it’s not required on the stickers themselves.

Most stickers use the [GT Flexa](https://www.grillitype.com/typeface/gt-flexa) typeface by Grillitype—for obvious licensing reasons we can’t distribute the font files. All text has been outlined in the SVGs.

## Where to print

We initially used Stickermule and their quality is exceptional, but they are also a [shitty](https://slate.com/business/2024/07/sticker-mule-ceos-pro-trump-maga-email-surprised-employees.html) company with a MAGA founder, so we advise against them and we don’t use their services anymore.

Instead, we’ve chosen [Sticker App](https://stickerapp.com) recently and can highly recommend them. Tons of options (e.g. backside printing), decent quality, fast delivery and reasonable prices.

## What do they look like?

You can find lots of photo impressions on the Village One website, [specifically on this page about our stickers](https://www.village.one/garden/library/village-one-stickers).
